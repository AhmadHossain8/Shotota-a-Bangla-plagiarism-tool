Bengali, with approximately 273 million speakers, is the seventh most spoken language in the world.
It is a language of immense richness, dating back to prehistoric times. The absence of a reliable
Bengali plagiarism detection tool is sad for the Bengali community, particularly in Bangladesh.
Our academic and professional landscape needs a dedicated Bangla plagiarism detection tool. The
lack of such a tool has adversely affected the educational landscape in Bangladesh, as journals
struggle to identify plagiarism in academic papers, and students often get away with copying content from external sources without consequences. ”As reported by tbsnews.net, plagiarism incidents
in Bangladesh’s universities are on the rise due to the unavailability of a reliable plagiarism detection
tool.” Book publishers also face challenges as they have to check for plagiarism manually, resulting in
a time-consuming and laborious process. This situation poses a significant obstacle to maintaining
academic integrity and fairness within the Bengali community. ”Copyright violations and plagiarism
are affecting the overall quality of higher education in Bangladesh, according to aa.com.tr.”
To address this issue, our plagiarism detection tool aims to provide a comprehensive platform
that caters to the specific needs of various domains. Because Current tools focus on significant
languages, leaving a critical gap for those working extensively in Bangla.
