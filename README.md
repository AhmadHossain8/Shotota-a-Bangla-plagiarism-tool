# Bangla Plagiarism Detection Tool

Bengali, with approximately 273 million speakers, is the seventh most spoken language in the world. It is a language of immense richness, dating back to prehistoric times. However, the absence of a reliable Bengali plagiarism detection tool has created a significant gap for the Bengali community, particularly in Bangladesh. Our project aims to address this issue by developing a dedicated Bangla plagiarism detection tool to support academic and professional landscapes.

## Problem Statement

The lack of a robust Bangla plagiarism detection tool has adversely affected the educational system in Bangladesh. Without proper tools, plagiarism incidents in academic institutions are increasing. As reported by [[tbsnews.net](https://www.tbsnews.net/bangladesh/education/no-policy-check-plagiarism-bangladesh-212194)], plagiarism incidents in Bangladeshâ€™s universities are on the rise due to the unavailability of reliable plagiarism detection tools. 

### Major Issues:
- **Academic Papers:** Journals struggle to identify plagiarism in academic papers, allowing students to copy content from external sources without consequences.
- **Book Publishing:** Book publishers often check for plagiarism manually, a time-consuming and laborious process.
- **Overall Academic Integrity:** Copyright violations and plagiarism are affecting the overall quality of higher education in Bangladesh.

## Our Solution

This tool aims to bridge the gap by providing a comprehensive platform specifically designed for the Bangla language. Most existing plagiarism detection tools focus on major global languages, leaving a critical gap for those working extensively in Bangla.

- **Bangla Language Support:** Tailored to the unique characteristics of the Bangla language.
- **Academic Focus:** Built for use in universities, journals, and educational institutions to promote academic integrity.
- **Time-Efficient:** Automates the plagiarism-checking process, reducing the need for manual work.
